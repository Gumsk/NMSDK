# Manipulating scenes imported into Blender

(Added in version 0.9.21)

When a scene is loaded in, all the values in the scene such as info about the meshes, and everything is stored in the blender scene.
When re-exporting, there is an option which exports all the values that are not modified.
Genrally this is useful if you are wanting to not add new meshes to a scene but do want to re-organise where objects are in a scene, remove objects from a scene, or add new references and scuh to a scene.
