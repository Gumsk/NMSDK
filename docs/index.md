# No Man's Sky (unofficial) Development Kit (NMSDK)

NMSDK is a plugin for blender which can be used to convert models to a format
compatible with No Man's Sky.
It is also able to generate action trigger sequences for custom interactions
and events in the game, as well as give the custom models specific properties
such as being able to be interactable, able to be flown as a ship, etc.

To get started developing with NMSDK, download the plugin [here](https://github.com/monkeyman192/NMSDK/releases).
